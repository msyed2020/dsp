-- What is a signal?

- A signal describes how one parameter RELATES to another
(signals are plotted on multiple axes to describe a relationship)

- Signals in the real world are naturally continuous
- It's when a continuous signal is passed thorugh an analog to
digital converter that the signal becomes digitized, or discrete
