Signal Statistics and Noise

-- What is a signal?

- A signal describes how one parameter RELATES to another
(signals are plotted on multiple axes to describe a relationship)

- Signals in the real world are naturally continuous
- It's when a continuous signal is passed thorugh an analog to
digital converter (ADC) that the signal becomes digitized, or discrete

-- Independent and Dependent Variables

- Signal is made up of two parameters, the independent variable and the
dependent variable
- Vertical axis represents the DEPENDENT variable
- Horizontal axis represents the INDEPENDENT variable
(independent - x-axis) (horizontal - y-axis)
- Dependent variable (y-axis) is a FUNCTION of the independent variable (x-axis)
- Functions usually tend to be y = x something lol
- Independent variable describes HOW AND WHEN a sample is taken
- Dependent variable is the ACTUAL measurement

-- Signal Samples

- Each digitized signal point is known as a SAMPLE
- The total # of samples is denoted by variable N

-- Mean and Standard Deviation

- Mean is the AVERAGE value of a signal
- It is found by adding all samples together, then
dividing the sum by total # of samples (N)
- Mean is denoted by mu (mu greek symbol from math lol)
- In electronics, the mean is also known as the DC value
- See figure1.jpg for formula

- Standard deviation is a measure of how far the signal
fluctuates from the mean
- The power of this fluctuation is known as variance
- Standard deviation is denoted by sigma greek symbol
- See figure2.jpg for formulas

- Variance is computed by squaring the standard deviation (sigma ^ 2)
- See figure3.jpg for formula

Sampling Theorem

-- Quantization

- Quantization is process of mapping continuous infinite values to a smaller set of discrete finite values
- Sample and Hold submodule converts independent variables (x-axis) from continuous to discrete
- Quantizer submodule converts dependent variables (y-axis) from continous to discrete
- Proper sampling is defined as the ability to reconstruct an exact analog signal from samples
- Sampling theorem states that a continuous signal can properly be sample ONLY IF it doesn't contain
frequency components above half the sampling rate
- Ex. if we sample at 50Hz (or 50 samples per second), the analog signal we are sampling MUST be made of
frequencies from 25Hz (25 cycles per second) and below
- This sampling theorem is also known as the Nyquist Theorem

- Before an analog signal enters the ADC, it is first passed through an analog filter
- This filter removes frequency components above half of the sampling rate. A filtered analog signal
is produced by this filter
- This is referred to as the anti-alias filter
- The filtered analog signal is passed through the ADC, and then a digitized signal is processed
- We can perform further digital processing on this signal if we wish
- If we wish to reconstruct our final analog signal, we can pass our output from our digital processing
through a DAC
- The output from the DAC is passed through another analog filter. This filter removes frequency components
above half the sampling rate
- This output filter is referred to as the reconstruction filter

-- Passive Filter

-- Passive Lowpass Filter

- This filter passes low frequencies and blocks high frequencies
- Constructed using only resistors and capacitors; it is also called the RC lowpass filter
- Waves from sensor pass by the Passive Lowpass Filter and go to the ADC
- The range of frequencies for which the filter causes a significant attenuation is
called the stopband
- On the contrary, the range of frequencies where the filter does NOT cause a significant attenuation (ranges other
than the stopband) is called the passband
- The cutoff frequency of an RC filter is the frequency in which the amplitude of the input signal is reduced
- This cutoff frequency is denoted by Fc
- At a high frequency, capacitor becomes a short circuit (a circuit connected to ground that doesn't exist)
- At a low frequency, capacitor becomes an open circuit
- Fc = 1 / 2*pi*RC (see figure4.jpg for formula)


-- Passive Highpass Filter

- This filter passes high frequencies and blocks low frequencies
- Constructed only using resistors and capacitors, hence considered RC
- In the highpass circuit, the resistor and capacitor location has swapped; resistor is connected to the ground
and capacitor is on the main circuit
- At a high frequency, the capacitor becomes a short circuit (turns into a wire and disappears)
- At a low frequency, the capacitor becomes an open circuit (broken/cut wire)
- Brick wall filter = ideal filter (a filter that doesn't exist, it has no 
transition between the passband and stopband)

-- Passive vs Active Filters

- Passive filters are made up of passive components only
- Passive components refer to resistors, capacitors, inductors
- Active filters, on the contrary, are made up of both active and passive components
- These include operational amplifiers (op amps) and transistors
- One of the advantages active filters have over passive filters is their ability to
provide signal gain (like to amplify the signal)
- See figure5.jpg for a photo of an Active Low Pass Filter
- See figure6.jpg for a photo of an Active High Pass Filter

- Most Common Configurations
  - Analog filters that are often used in real world applications are
  Chebyshev, Butterworth, and Bessel

- Poles and Zeroes of a transfer function are frequencies for which the value of a
denominator and numerator of a transfer function become zero, respectively. The values
of poles and zeroes of a system determine whether or not the system is stable
