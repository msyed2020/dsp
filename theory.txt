Signal Statistics and Noise

-- What is a signal?

- A signal describes how one parameter RELATES to another
(signals are plotted on multiple axes to describe a relationship)

- Signals in the real world are naturally continuous
- It's when a continuous signal is passed thorugh an analog to
digital converter (ADC) that the signal becomes digitized, or discrete

-- Independent and Dependent Variables

- Signal is made up of two parameters, the independent variable and the
dependent variable
- Vertical axis represents the DEPENDENT variable
- Horizontal axis represents the INDEPENDENT variable
(independent - x-axis) (horizontal - y-axis)
- Dependent variable (y-axis) is a FUNCTION of the independent variable (x-axis)
- Functions usually tend to be y = x something lol
- Independent variable describes HOW AND WHEN a sample is taken
- Dependent variable is the ACTUAL measurement

-- Signal Samples

- Each digitized signal point is known as a SAMPLE
- The total # of samples is denoted by variable N

-- Mean and Standard Deviation

- Mean is the AVERAGE value of a signal
- It is found by adding all samples together, then
dividing the sum by total # of samples (N)
- Mean is denoted by mu (mu greek symbol from math lol)
- In electronics, the mean is also known as the DC value
- See figure1.jpg for formula

- Standard deviation is a measure of how far the signal
fluctuates from the mean
- The power of this fluctuation is known as variance
- Standard deviation is denoted by sigma greek symbol
- See figure2.jpg for formulas

- Variance is computed by squaring the standard deviation (sigma ^ 2)
- See figure3.jpg for formula

Sampling Theorem

-- Quantization

- Quantization is process of mapping continuous infinite values to a smaller set of discrete finite values
